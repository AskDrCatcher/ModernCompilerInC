ModernCompilerInC
=================

Implementation of a modern compiler in C from Appel's book. I am learning from Appel's book currently
and I like the hands on approach to create the compiler for the Tiger (huh ?) language.
This repo will host the code present in the book with modifications from me (maybe) wherever I see fit
during my learning process.
