ModernCompilerInC
=================

Implementation of a modern compiler in C from Appel's book. I am learning from Appel's book currently
and I like the hands on approach to create the compiler for the Tiger (huh ?) language.
This repo will host the code present in the book with modifications from me (maybe) wherever I see fit
during my learning process.

Seriously ?
==========

Yes. Seriously. There is nothing to look for here except how I fumble, rise and again fumble while I try to collect and put together all the code present in the book all the while providing a store house to the fully functional modern compiler for a not so modern language!
